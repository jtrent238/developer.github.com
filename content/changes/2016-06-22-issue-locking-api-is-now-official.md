We're making the [Issue locking and unlocking APIs][issue-locking-blog-post] part of the official GitHub API.

During the preview period you needed to provide the `application/vnd.github.the-key-preview+json` preview media type in the `Accept` header to opt-in to the new endpoints. Now that the preview period has ended, you no longer need to specify this custom [media type][custom-media-types].

If you have any questions or feedback, please [get in touch with us][contact]!
